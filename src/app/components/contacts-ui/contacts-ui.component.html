<h2>How it Works</h2>
<div>
    This was a small demonstration of my usage of Angular and a bit of site design. 
    Like I said above, this is a responsive UI, so it will adapt to your screen's size 
    dynamically, so it should work quite well on both mobile and desktop. This site 
    has a responsive UI as well, but it's a bit simpler.

    Since it was supposed to be a contacts app, I also wanted profile pictures, but 
    the API doesn't have them, so I took a page from Google's auto-generated default 
    profile pictures and made my own. The background colours are generated deterministically 
    based on the name of the contact. Similar names should yield similar colours. It basically 
    splits the name into three substrings and uses an scaled average of the included letters 
    to generate a RGB value.
