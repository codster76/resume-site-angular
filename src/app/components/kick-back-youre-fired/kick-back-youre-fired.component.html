<h2>What is it?</h2>
<div>
    My team's submission for the GMTK Game Jam 2023, where the theme was "roles reversed". 
    This was made in 48 hours using Unity.
</div>
<div>
    We thought hard about how to substantially incorporate the theme, which led to a bunch 
    of ideas - with my favourite scrapped idea being a retro FPS where you'd throw newspapers 
    back at delivery boys as payback for spamming you with junk mail. The one we chose in the 
    end was a lot better, though, since the use of the theme was threefold and was both 
    mechanically and thematically consistent: <br /><br />

    - You fire a gun to move and you move to deal damage. Your bullets are harmless, but ramming 
    into people with the recoil is deadly.<br />
    - You are literally riding an office chair in reverse.<br />
    - You are a disgraced CEO "climbing" back up the corporate chain.<br />

<h2>Design Thoughts</h2>
<div>
    The game was pretty heavily inspired by Hotline Miami with the intended approach to the 
    levels, just with a bit more of a focus on traversal, rather than combat.
</div>
<br />

<div>
    The game was designed to be hard to control, yet satisfying, which I think was achieved 
    reasonably well. It was a fine balance between weapon force, fire rate, character drag and 
    character bounce.
</div>
<br />

<div>
    Enemy design was pretty challenging because we couldn't make them too smart of powerful, 
    yet we still needed them to be an obstacle. I put a lot of time into making the ranged 
    enemies behave in a properly. They needed to attack you on sight and search for you when 
    you're out of sight and I wanted to make it look convincing. My friend Hugh made the hunter 
    enemy (the really fast red guy near the end of the game), which ended up working out great, 
    with it crashing into walls and flying past corners due to speed and inertia. It really 
    achieved a natural-feeling chase sequence.
