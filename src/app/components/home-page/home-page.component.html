<div style="max-width: 50%">
    Welcome to my resume/portfolio site. I am Cody Liu and I am primarily a programmer, with a mix of other skills, like digital art and music. Every page demonstrates some of my previous work and a bit of background and/or explanation on them. Don’t feel too obligated to read everything I write on every page because I do go into a lot of longwinded detail about everything. The “What is it?” sections of each page give a basic summary of each thing. The rest is there if you want more detail, so I hope you find it interesting.
