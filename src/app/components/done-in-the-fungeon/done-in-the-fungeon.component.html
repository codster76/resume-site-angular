<div>Sorry, mobile users, but this game is only functional on desktops.</div>
<br />
<div>
    <h3>Controls:</h3>
    WASD = Move<br />
    Space = Dash (Has iframes at the beginning)<br />
    Left Shift (Hold) = Charged Attack<br />
    P = Basic Combo<br />
    R = Reset the ball in golf rooms<br />

    Tips:<br />
    - You can dash further by moving before you dash.<br />
    - Orange hitboxes can be dashed through. Red cannot.<br />
    - The charged attack has a very long range and strong knockback.<br />
    - All of your attacks can pierce walls.<br />
    - After each level, you are given a choice between three items. Attack up, HP up 
    or instant healing. You can only pick one.<br />
    <br />

    Note: Some of the settings can crash the game in this build.

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<div>This was the capstone project for my university course, where we had to design and 
    create our own games over the course of around 6 months.</div>
<br />

<h2>Design and Development Retrospective</h2>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<div>The entire project was made using the Unity game engine, with C# as the scripting 
    language. I made all of the player controls, enemy behaviour, interactive objects, 
    stage hazards and puzzles from scratch.</div>
<br />
<div>In particular, I’d like to note the pathfinding system. I had created a node system 
    using Unity’s collision and physics engine and allowed enemies to path find towards a 
    target based on a breadth-first search of the current room. The breadth-first search 
    always returned the shortest viable path to the target, which allowed enemies to path around 
    obstacles and through mazes without getting stuck. While this method of pathfinding is 
    rather outdated and becomes extremely inefficient at larger scales (breadth-first search 
    is not very efficient for large search spaces), it was simple to implement and worked well 
    for the single rooms it was confined to in this game.</div>
<br />

<h3>Design</h3>
<div>The overarching idea for this game was to present a large variety of things to the 
    player while keeping the player’s ability to interact with it consistent (attacks, 
    evasion, movement). It was inspired by the WarioWare series, which uses a similar 
    principles for when and how it presents its minigames, generally grouping them based on 
    the control scheme you’re intended to use.</div>
<br />
<div>The other part of the game’s design I had to work with were the constraints, which were 
    primarily the physical space, assets and time. The entire game was to take place on a small 
    grid of squares, where elements could not be any more granular than a single grid, which 
    informed a lot of the level and puzzle design, it acted to keep things fairly simple. As for 
    the asset and time limitations, I was creating almost all of the assets from scratch, so it 
    was important to make effective use of each one. It also works as a player teaching tool to 
    reuse familiar mechanics.</div>
<br />

<h3>Assets</h3>
<div>Aside from the music and UI elements, I had created all of the sprites and sound effects 
    myself using Krita to make the sprites and FamiTracker to create the sound effects. The art 
    style of this game was inspired by classic NES games, primarily The Legend of Zelda. The style 
    presents a simple and clean view of the game so that players could easily see what was going on. 
    The grid-based nature of the game also kept everything at a reasonable scale to design around 
    and for players to see.</div>
