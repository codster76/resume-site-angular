<h2>What is it?</h2>
<div>
    This is the system I used to create the pixel borders of all of the buttons and elements you 
    see on this site. It's made using pure CSS and will work at any arbitary size, which you should 
    be able to play with on this page. I'm a stickler for consistent pixel sizes, so I made this to 
    ensure that all pixels on this site would be identical in size, no matter how large or small any 
    element was.
    <br /><br />
    On a related note, you might notice the background dynamically resizes based on the height of the 
    page. It works similarly.

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<div>
    It's actually quite simple. I'm leveraging the ability to render and manipulate multiple background 
    images in a single element. Basically, I have single pixel assets (literally just square images with 
    a single colour) that are being rendered as background images. Singular pixels (the corners are the 
    main example) can just be placed in positions relative to the element's edges. Lines can be drawn by 
    taking advantage of background tiling. You might be wondering why I don't just use CSS borders and/or 
    outlines, and that's because of the inability to draw them inside an element and their behaviour at 
    corners, which meet at diagonals instead of overlapping. This seriously breaks the pixel art aesthetic. 
    My approach is cleaner and opens up opportunities for even more intricate designs.
